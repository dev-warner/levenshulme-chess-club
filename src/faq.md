_Q. Where are you based?_
[The Talleyrand](https://www.instagram.com/talleyrandmcr/) in Levenshulme, a great little pub 5 minutes from Levenshulme train station and next door to the Crimson Rose Tattoo Studio. More specifically we’re situated in the back room of the Talleyrand, you know, the coolest part of any bar. If you’re unsure ask the bar staff and they’ll point you over to us. We’ll be the ones with all the chess sets.

_Q. Do I need to be good at chess to come?_
Heck no! In fact the opposite is encouraged, if all attendees could be worse than the flatly mediocre players who are organising and running Levy Chess then that would be great.

_Q. Do I need to bring my own chess set?_
In a word, no. But in many words to pad out the search value of this page and jam in a few more keywords about chess, Levenshulme and the fun casual setting, no.

_Q. Do you have any house rules?_
Generally speaking the normal rules apply, rooks go sidey sidey, pawns go up but not back and no one knows how en-passant works. Essentially we want this to be as casual or as serious as people want it to be, we’ll play it by ear.

_Q. Is there a quick, easy and free way to stay engaged in all of our collective chess endeavours?_
I’m glad you asked, we have now made a team on [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/team/levy-chess) that you can join with the password Levychess, get over there and join.
