# Levy Chess

## A Levenshulme based casual chess evening at the Talleyrand. Every other Monday from 7:30pm.

If the pandemic has taught us anything it’s that some things are better in person. A boom in chess enthusiasm from the Queen’s Gambit and all this free time has created a glut of new chess players who’ve never actually sat and moved real chess pieces like a proper person. It’s our aim to make that happen for the people of Levenshulme.

Hence Levy Chess. Our attempt to insert a bit of normality back into our lives and commit to doing something outside, well not actually outside, but out of our house for once. Levy chess aims to be Levenshulme’s premier causal pretence to drink on a Monday. Plus actually also maybe play chess.

If you or anyone you know wants to come for an evening where you can play chess and not feel weird about it then consider this an open invite (COVID restrictions and attendance dependent). We want Levy chess to be an environment where anyone can meet and use chess as a pretense to come together and do something with their monday nights.
