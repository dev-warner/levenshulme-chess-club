In December 2020 our smartest, kindest and clumsiest friend, lost his life. Jack was a terrifically intelligent person but never arrogant, the perfect disposition for a Chess player. Like with everything after someone dies too young, you only see what they never did, who they never met and what they never got to experience.

When we lost him I found myself revisiting our games online and playing the moves out again and again, imagining his face, the questions he’d ask and the knowledge we would share if we were playing in person. I wish we had played enough for him to beat me eventually but we never did. He was always pure trash at Chess.

Jack never got good at chess. It’s a small thing and I definitely did enjoy taking his pieces when we played online, not least because Jack was so much more knowledgeable about essentially everything else in life than I was. Jack would have beat me eventually, he just never put the time in like I have. He was off developing skills as a machine learning specialist, leading a socially fulfilling life and being loved by everyone I know. But when COVID and the Queens Gambit came along, I was laughing.

Jack and I never played over the board, he got into Chess last year when COVID had him cooped up and looking for something to do with his big ol’ brain. We played online but I could tell it was never something he truly got into like I know he would have if he had someone to play with in person and talk about the game. Jack was a social creature and I know the lack of pubs and socialising with his friends is something that affected him deeply.

I want Levy chess to be a representation of something that I know the youngest son from an incredible family of brewers would appreciate. A load of friends having an excuse to meet up to do something on a Monday night and support a struggling industry. I don’t know if anyone in Jack's family plays Chess but it's definitely an Aesthetic I know gels with their incredibly warm home. Jack enjoyed games of all sorts, he was competitive but never cruel, skilled but not cocky and always full of grace when he lost.

Jack dying was the low point in a lot of lives and I’m sure I’m not the only one who misses him every day. With that said, summer is here and I would like to spend some time with my friends in a pub, maybe meet some new faces and raise whatever we can for Giving What We Can. A great charity that uses machine learning to determine how best to allocate funds to various causes around the world. It’s exactly the type of nerd stuff Jack loved.

If you would like to donate to Giving What we Can I know that Jack's family would appreciate that greatly. Or any donation you make to any organisation in his honour. Unless it’s like Boko Haram or one of those charities that raise money for seaside donkey’s. The donkey’s have enough.

To anyone reading this who also knew Jack, just know that I miss seeing you, even if I get your name wrong at the Christmas Party. I love you all.
