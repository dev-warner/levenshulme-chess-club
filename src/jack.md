In December 2020 our smartest, kindest and clumsiest friend, lost his life.

Like with everything after someone dies too young, you only see what they never did, who they never met and everything they never got to experience. There are thousands of things that Jack never got to do and perhaps the least important out of any of those things is that he never got good at Chess.

It’s a small thing but it still hurts. I always enjoyed beating him don't get me wrong, not least because of how intellectually inferior Jack made me feel by just existing usually. Alas, Jack was always straight trash on the board.

He would have beaten me eventually I have no doubt, he just hadn't put the time in like I had. While I was playing Chess, Jack was off becoming a machine learning specialist, leading a socially fulfilling life and being loved by everyone I know. But when COVID and the Queens Gambit came along, I was laughing.

When we lost him I found myself revisiting our games online and playing the moves out again and again, imagining his face, the questions he would have asked and the conversations we would have had if only we were playing in person.

Having never got to play over the board with Jack, the image of sitting across from him is something that still hurts a bit to think about. We played online from time to time but I could tell it was never something he truly got into like I know he would have if he’d only had more time and opportunities to play with friends.

Being a deeply sociable person, Jack possessed the kind of sincere social energy that brought people together. His parties were legendary, the Afters were always at his flat and he’d always be down for any game you could suggest. I know that being locked inside for most of 2020 is something that affected Jack deeply and that he'd certainly be all over the idea of doing anything now that pubs are open again.

We want Levy Chess to be a representation of that same social energy and a response to this year of isolation we've all had. It's a night that's less concerned with the game and more about seeing one another. Plus there's draught beer which was usually enough to get Jack out anywhere.

Jack dying was the low point in a year of low points and I’m sure I’m not the only one who misses him every day. With that said, summer is here and I would like to spend some time with my friends in a pub and maybe meet some new faces while we’re at it.

We would also like to take this as an opportunity to support a charity called Giving What We Can, a charity which uses machine learning to determine how best to allocate funds to various causes around the world. It’s exactly the type of nerd stuff Jack loved.

If you would like to donate to Giving What We Can today in Jack's honour, I know that is something that Jack's family would appreciate. I’m also sure that any donation you make to any organisation in his honour would be greatly appreciated. Unless it’s like Boko Haram or one of those charities that raise money for seaside donkeys.

To anyone reading this who also loved Jack, just know that I miss seeing you and I hope I can see you soon.
